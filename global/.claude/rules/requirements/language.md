# Requirements Language

> Governs the wording of requirements, acceptance criteria, and commitments in generated
> documents. Read the scope boundary in [README.md](README.md) first — these rules do **not**
> apply to skill instruction prose.

## The Principle

**Describe the delivered world as a fact, not the project's intentions about it.**

A requirement states how things *are* once the solution is in place. Written that way it is
either true or false at verification time, and there is no hedge to argue about.

| Instead of | Write |
|---|---|
| The system should respond within 3 seconds | Search results are returned within 3 seconds |
| We will encrypt data in transit | Data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.3 |
| Users may be notified of despatch | Customer despatch notification is issued within 5 minutes |
| The service shall be available 99.9% of the time | Service availability is 99.9% per calendar month |

## Voice by Altitude

Two registers. Applying the wrong one at the wrong level is the most common error.

| Element | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Capability / feature name | **Noun phrase** | `Customer despatch notification` |
| Requirement or story title | **Active, verb-first** | `Notify customer of despatch` |
| "I want" clause | **Active, verb-first**, solution-agnostic | `Notify the customer when despatch occurs` |
| Acceptance criterion | **Noun-first, passive, declarative** | `Despatch notification is issued within 5 minutes of consignment scan` |
| ORD requirement-table row | **Noun phrase** in `Requirement`; value in `Threshold` | `Despatch notification latency` / `≤ 5 min` |

Titles command. Criteria state. The criterion form is deliberate: leading with the noun and
using the passive leaves **no grammatical slot for a modal verb**, so the failure this ruleset
exists to prevent becomes hard to write rather than merely discouraged.

## Banned in Generated Requirements

**Modals — never appear in a requirement, criterion, or commitment:**
`could` · `should` · `would` · `may` · `might`

They make the statement unfalsifiable: a criterion that *may* be met cannot fail a test.

**`shall` — permitted but avoided.** It is not ambiguous, but the declarative present is
shorter and reads as a fact rather than an obligation. Prefer the rewrite; do not treat an
existing correct `shall` as a defect.

**Constructions — never:**
`allow me to` · `allows the user to` · `enables` · `is able to` · `can [verb]`

These describe a capability the solution grants rather than an outcome that is true. `can` is
the most common offender and the easiest to miss:

> ✗ `Then they can complete the purchase without re-entering card details`
> ✓ `Purchase completion is available to a returning customer without card re-entry`

**Never write "the system"** — or "the platform", "the application", "the solution". Name the
product, service, or component. Where no name exists yet, use the `[SYSTEM-NAME-TBD]`
placeholder the skill already defines, and resolve it before the document is approved.

## Vagueness

Unquantified adjectives are not requirements: `fast`, `reliable`, `intuitive`, `robust`,
`scalable`, `secure`, `user-friendly`. Either give a threshold and a measurement method, or
write `[TBD — source: "quoted vague statement"]` and leave the gap visible. Never quantify by
invention.

Quantification alone is **not** sufficient — "The system should respond within 3 seconds" is
quantified and still fails this ruleset. Both the number and the form are required.

## Narrative Sections

Background, mission context, operational scenarios and day-in-the-life narratives are prose by
design and are exempt from the noun-first criterion form. They remain subject to the modal ban
and the "the system" ban, and they must never introduce a commitment that does not also appear
as a row (see [tables.md](tables.md)).

## Recorded Deviations from ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018

`/write-prd` cites 29148. This ruleset deviates from it twice, deliberately:

1. **Declarative present is preferred over `shall`.** 29148 makes `shall` the canonical binding
   verb. We prefer the end-state form because it is shorter and verifiable as a statement of
   fact. `shall` remains valid, so this is a preference, not a conflict.
2. **Passive voice is mandated for acceptance criteria.** 29148 recommends active voice on the
   grounds that passive hides the actor. Accepted and mitigated: where the actor is
   load-bearing — authorisation, non-repudiation, audit, and anything in ORD §3.3 Security —
   name the actor explicitly and use the active voice. Elsewhere the passive is what makes
   noun-first possible once "the system" is banned.

Neither deviation is silent: any document claiming 29148 conformance cites this file.

**Not aligned to ASD-STE100.** Simplified Technical English mandates active voice and the
imperative, and governs technical *documentation* (procedures, manuals), not requirements.
Downstream operational artefacts — runbooks, operator and field procedures — may adopt STE
independently; requirements documents do not.

## Never

- Never use `could`, `should`, `would`, `may`, or `might` in a requirement, criterion, or commitment.
- Never write `enables`, `is able to`, `allows … to`, or `can [verb]` in a criterion.
- Never refer to "the system", "the platform", "the application", or "the solution".
- Never treat quantification as sufficient — a hedged number is still a hedge.
- Never invent a threshold to avoid writing `[TBD]`.
- Never apply these rules to the skills' own instruction prose (see [README.md](README.md)).
