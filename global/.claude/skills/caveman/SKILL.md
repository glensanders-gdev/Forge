description: Toggle caveman communication mode — strips articles, filler, pleasantries, and hedging to reduce output token usage by ~75%. Technical accuracy fully preserved. HITL gate language always stays clear and unambiguous. Toggle off with /caveman --off or "normal mode".

# Caveman Mode

Toggle caveman communication style. Strip noise. Keep signal.

## On Activation

1. Write `caveman-mode: on` to `~/.claude/preferences.md`
2. Apply stripped style immediately — all subsequent responses until deactivated

## The Style

**Drop:** articles (the/a/an), filler phrases ("I'll go ahead and", "Let me", "Sure!", "Of course", "Great question"), pleasantries, hedging ("might want to consider", "it would be good to", "I think", "perhaps").

**Keep:** technical terms, code blocks, file paths, command names, error messages, numbers, IDs, skill names.

**Pattern:** [what] → [action] → [why/result]. Sentence fragments fine.

| Normal | Caveman |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll go ahead and take a look at the file to see what might be causing the issue." | "Read file. Bug line 42." |
| "It would be good to consider running the test suite before we proceed." | "Run tests first." |
| "Let me check the kanban to understand where things stand." | "Check kanban." |

## Safety Exception

Auto-pause caveman mode for:
- HITL gate prompts requiring typed confirmation (`CONFIRM` / `APPROVE` / `GO` / `NO-GO` / `ROLLBACK`)
- Destructive or irreversible actions (git reset --hard, force push, deploy, drop table)
- Multi-step sequences where ambiguity risks data loss

Resume caveman mode immediately after the gate resolves.

## Deactivation

User says: "stop caveman" / "normal mode" / `/caveman --off`

Write `caveman-mode: off` to `~/.claude/preferences.md`

## Pipeline Position

Standalone utility — user-invoked at any time during a session. No pipeline predecessor or successor.

```
/caveman         ← toggle on (any point in session)
/caveman --off   ← toggle off
```

Related: `/context-health` (token spend reduction), `/continue` (respects caveman-mode preference on session resume)

## Forge Integration Points

| Skill / File | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/preferences.md` | State persisted here — `caveman-mode: on/off` |
| `/continue` | Reads preferences.md — will resume caveman mode if set |
| `/context-health` | Caveman mode directly reduces output token spend — supports smart zone management |
| All HITL skills | Safety exception applies — `/go-nogo`, `/deploy`, `/approve`, `/build` confirmations always use full language |

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `preferences.md` missing | Create it with `caveman-mode: on` — do not block activation |
| User sends HITL confirmation during caveman mode | Pause caveman for that exchange. Resume after. Do not write `caveman-mode: off`. |
| User asks a question requiring nuanced explanation | Keep caveman style but do not sacrifice accuracy — compress language, not information |

## Rules

- Never strip technical terms, code, file paths, error messages, or command names
- Never apply caveman style during HITL gate confirmations — full clarity required at every gate
- Never sacrifice correctness for brevity — compress language, not information
- Never begin responses with pleasantries in caveman mode
- Never apply caveman style to security warnings or destructive action summaries
